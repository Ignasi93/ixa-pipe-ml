# ClearAdaptiveFeatures: ONLY WORKS with CONLL formats!!
# Specify if adaptive features be cleared in the training and/or evaluation data.
# Options are: 'yes', 'no','docstart'. The first two will reset the
# features every sentence whereas the 'docstart' option will look for -DOCSTART-
# marks in the data to clear the adaptive features.
# Crossvalidation only works if ClearTrainingFeatures is set to 'yes'.
# If commented out both values default to 'no'
